            <h3>Coin Exchange</h3>
            <p>The Nugen Coin exchange service allows you to exchange your Nugen Coins for Ethereum through your connected MetaMask wallet. The exchange rate is subject to real-time market values.</p>
            
            <h3>MetaMask Wallet Connection</h3>
            <p>Users must connect their MetaMask wallet to initiate the exchange process. Ensure your wallet is secure and do not share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone.</p>
            
            <h3>Email Verification</h3>
            <p>For security purposes, users are required to verify their email address. Your email address is used to confirm transactions and for recovery purposes only.</p>
            
            <h3>Transaction Process</h3>
            <p>Transactions are processed using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Users must have sufficient Ethereum in their wallet to cover transaction fees (gas).</p>
            
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>We strive to ensure the security of all transactions but cannot guarantee complete security due to the nature of blockchain technology. Users transact at their own risk.</p>
